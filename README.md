## About
*Jaan Tollander de Balsch* is a computational scientist with a computer science and applied mathematics background. Professionally, he applies his skills for technical writing, research software engineering, and scientific computing using tools such as **Julia language**, **Git-based workflows**, and **Linux operating system**. He values writing well-tested and documented open-source software packages with clean interfaces that other developers can understand and use. He has experience developing software packages for simulation algorithms and mathematical optimization models and running code on high-performance computing environments.


## Personal Projects
On my [**Website**](https://jaantollander.com/), I write articles related to computer science, applied mathematics, and productivity in knowledge work. For example, I have written articles about [programming with the Julia language](https://jaantollander.com/tag/julia-language/) and how to use [Markdown for scientific writing](https://jaantollander.com/post/scientific-writing-with-markdown/). Also, you can find more information about me on the website and my online [**Resume**](https://jaantollander.com/resume) if you want to read more in-depth about my work.

I also create [**Videos**](https://www.youtube.com/c/jaantollander) on YouTube. My videos are typically related to my articles and projects. With the videos, I aim to present clear, step-by-step instructions for various technical tasks, such as [making GitHub repositories citable with Zenodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9FGAU9S9Ow) or [configuring semantic-release for a Julia package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_npnsESXRno).

Finally, I am writing shorter, less technical articles to my [**Newsletter**](https://world.hey.com/jaan/) about tools, technologies, and resources related to productivity in knowledge work. *(Work-in-Progress!)*

## [CSC - IT Center for Science](https://www.csc.fi/en/)
During summer 2021, I worked in the *Cloud group* at CSC, testing their cloud services from the customer's perspective using their publicly available documentation. I created a web application with Julia language, [**GenieWebApp.jl**](https://github.com/csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl), which I deployed to a virtual machine via OpenStack and OpenShift container platform using both the web user and command-line interfaces. All the steps are fully [**documented**](https://csc-training.github.io/GenieWebApp.jl/dev/). We can use the documentation to learn how to use virtual machines or deploy applications as containers.

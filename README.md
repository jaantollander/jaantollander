## About
Hi! 
I am *Jaan Tollander de Balsch*, a computational scientist with a computer science and applied mathematics background.
Professionally, I have installed, configured, and run software on high-performance computing environments, written technical documentation, and developed software packages for mathematical optimization models and simulation algorithms.
I value well-tested and documented open-source software packages with clean interfaces that other developers can understand and use.
I prefer working with Linux, command-line tools, and the Julia language. 

On my [**website**](https://jaantollander.com/), I write articles related to computer science, applied mathematics, and productivity in knowledge work.
For example, I have written articles about [programming with the Julia language](https://jaantollander.com/tag/julia-language/) and how to use [Markdown for scientific writing](https://jaantollander.com/post/scientific-writing-with-markdown/).
Also, you can find more information about me on the website and my online [**resume**](https://jaan.me) if you want to read a summary of my work.

I also create [**videos**](https://www.youtube.com/c/jaantollander) on YouTube.
My videos are typically related to my articles and projects.
With the videos, I aim to present clear, step-by-step instructions for various technical tasks, such as [making GitHub repositories citable with Zenodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9FGAU9S9Ow) or [configuring semantic-release for a Julia package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_npnsESXRno).

<!--
Finally, I am writing shorter, less technical articles to my [**Newsletter**](https://world.hey.com/jaan/) about tools, technologies, and resources related to productivity in knowledge work. *(Work-in-Progress!)*
